# DataZCW-Final-Project
capstone project for ZCW Data's course.

## Final Group Project Possibles

- How To Build a Neural Network to Recognize Handwritten Digits with TensorFlow
  - ye olde scanning chestnut
  - handwriting recognition
- Image Processing for Feature Identification
  - "Hot dog or not" but for X
- Sentiment Analysis
  - From twitter feeds
  - From facebook feeds
  - Or?
  - provides realtime view of crowdsourced "zeitgeist" on a hot topic
- Recommendation Engine
  - Music, Books, Wine, TV/Movies, Sports
  - if you like X, you'll like Y
- Search Engine of Documents, DataSets, APIs?? (Map/reduce)
  - Google lite
  - Google images
  - popularity or relevance measures

## Group Size

Each group should 2-4 people. Effort should be mostly
Data Engineering, but at the end, do some actaul Data Science.
So a model, or prediction, or something based on the data that
has flowed through the project.

EACH person must have a clear understanding of everything in the project.
Each person should have parts they alone have done, something they've explained to their teammates.

## Required stages

- Identify Scope of Project
  - Find APIs that could help
  - Find DataSets that might be useful
- Each project should have
  - 2 or more piplines that collect data from sources
    - Extra bonus for "streaming api" usage
  - A cache sql/nosql database that acts as a data lake
  - A series of Spark drivers that wrangle the data into a final form
  - Final data stored back in the cache database
  - A Data Viz and/or Dashbord showing the analysis done (of the data flows)
- A Model which makes some prediction based on the data
  - a ad-hoc prediction request
  - or other insight into the data
  
  ## Tech choices
  
  All tech choices will be approved by instructors. 
  Any tech we've studied is fair game for use.
  All project must have some **Airflow** portion AND some **Spark** portion somewhere within the project.
  All projects must have some python scripts, SQL/NoSQL database, and make use of some data visualization outputs and
  kind of dashboard. (You may use any dashboard tech that is cleared with instrutors).
